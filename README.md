# Anti-Soccer-Game-Iphone-App
the important code from my anti-soccer iphone game. posted for a record of my programming

in this game you are the soccer ball, running away from players trying to kick you. 
you advance to the next level by running into the goal.

these are the main files with the base code for my first iphone app. i went from never having made an app to this code and a working app in less than two weeks. it's a clean and good app, however my future apps will likely be more complex and bigger.
